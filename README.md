# Searcher

Searcher is a project where users can search for anything on the web as they would on any other web browser. Featuring search functions such as regular web searches, image searches, news searches, and even video searches. Users are also able to switch between light mode and dark mode depending on preference.
Searcher is made using the React framework, search requests made to the Google Search API, and styling done with Tailwind CSS.
